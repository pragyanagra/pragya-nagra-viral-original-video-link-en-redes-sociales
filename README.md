The actress made her way to modelling after she developed an interest in the field post her college studies in Delhi.

The actress currently has 1.1M followers on her Instagram account, while she made her Tamil film industry debut in 2022, with ‘Varalaru Mukkiyam’. Her latest film was a Telugu movie, ‘Laggam’, which was released on November 22.
